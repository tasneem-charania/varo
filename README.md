# VaroApp

This project is an example of the MERN stack

## Build And Run
Run `npm run dev` for a dist build. In a new tab run `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Pre Requirements
You will need a mongoDB connection. Check out mLabs if you need one.
You will need to use POSTMAN or CURL to create a user first by hitting this API `/api/users` using a POST request.
